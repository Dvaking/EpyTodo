## General Info

The project idea is to **build a Todo List**. Thanks to it, you‚Äôll be able to handle all the tasks you need to do
easily! We will mainly **focus on the ‚Äúbackend‚Äù** side of the project, but feel free to show us what you can by
**building a ‚Äúfrontend‚Äù** to your project as a bonus.
